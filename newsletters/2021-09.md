## OBF News

### The OBF is having its public board meeting

The OBF will hold its annual public board meeting virtually online on September 21. A big topic on the agenda is the election of new board members. You can read more on the [OBF blog](FIX LINK).


### OBF Event Fellowships

Our [call for applications is open again, with a **deadline on October 1st**](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/). We invite applications for financial support to attend or (new!) host virtual events in 2021.

The fellowship can be used to cover registration fees and potentially additional expenses such as small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), childcare for the duration of the event or high-speed internet.

Due to the ongoing pandemic and lockdowns & travel restriction associated with it we again will only consider virtual events.
