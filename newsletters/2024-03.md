# OBF Newsletter March 2024

TL;DR: In this newsletter we provide key dates for BOSC 2024; share the upcoming OBF event fellowship, and XXX.

In longer form: 

## OBF News

### BOSC news

The 25th(!) annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024) will take place on July 15/16 as part of ISMB 2024 in Montréal, Canada, and online. As in prior years, there will be a _CollaborationFest_, a collaborative work event (including but not limited to hacking) happening around BOSC, this year right after the event on July 17/18.

There is still time to submit your abstracts for posters and talks. And there is even an early poster submission/acceptance route that you can use if having an accepted contribution helps with your travel planning. 

The key submission/notification dates are: 

* March 21, 2024: [Early Poster Acceptance submission deadline](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/03/09/bosc-early-poster-acceptance/)
* March 29: Early Poster Acceptance notification
* April 19: Regular abstract submission deadline (talks and posters)
* May 13: Talk/poster acceptance notification
* May 20: Late poster submission deadline

The actual conference dates are:

* July 12-16, 2024: ISMB 2024 (Montréal, Canada and online)
* July 15-16, 2024: BOSC 2024 (part of ISMB)
* July 17-18: Post-BOSC CollaborationFest


### OBF Event Fellowships

Next round: April 1, 2024

The current application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until April 1, 2024. So there is still some [time to get your application submitted](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMayX_XwTLxc8MiYgQOHIILJNjxF0gL75TUsbaO17h5UuUeA/viewform).

These fellowships are ideal to support your virtual or in-person BOSC attendance, but can be used to cover registration fees for relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as travel, lodging, childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet. You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/#fellowships-applications), and [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

### ISCBacademy recordings

The OBF hosted two _ISCBacademy webinars_ since the last newsletter: 

On October 3 we collaborated with the _Bio-Ontologies_ COSI and had Sierra Moxon speak about _"LinkML: an open data modeling framework, grounded with ontologies"_. The recording of this talk is on YouTube. 

And On March 5, 2024, the OBF [hosted an _ISCBacademy webinar_ with Gemma Turon](https://www.open-bio.org/2024/02/08/iscbacademy-gemma-turon/). As the co-founder and CEO of the _Ersilia Open Source Initiative_ she presented on _Ersilia, open source AI/ML for (antimicrobial) drug discovery_. The recording of the talk is now on YouTube.


## Community updates

### CWL Conference 2024

The [2024 Common Workflow Language Conference](https://www.commonwl.org/conferences/2024/) will be held primarily on the campus of VU Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, on Wednesday & Thursday May 15th & 16th. The event will be followed by a contribution-a-thon on that Friday. The conference talks will be also presented online, and there will be two online-only sessions the week prior at times convenient elsewhere in the world.

The call for submissions will open later in February 2024 with signups for attendance to follow.

## Your content needed for the next issue!

Tell us about the things that catch your attention in the open source bioinformatics world! If you have an exciting project update, request for feedback, or interesting link, [feel free to share it with us on GitHub](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/issues/40), or contact Bastian Greshake Tzovaras (Mastodon: [@gedankenstuecke@scholar.social](https://scholar.social/@gedankenstuecke), Email: [bgreshake@gmail.com](mailto:bgreshake@gmail.com)) if you're not sure whether or not your content is suitable for our newsletter. We're looking for content that's primarily open source / science related.
