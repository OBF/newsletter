# OBF Newsletter March 2024

TL;DR: In this newsletter we provide key dates for BOSC 2024, share the upcoming OBF event fellowship application deadline, highlight an upcoming ISCBacademy talk, and share upcoming community opportunities.

In longer form: 

## OBF News

### BOSC news

The 25th(!) annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024) will take place on July 15/16 as part of ISMB 2024 in Montréal, Canada, and online. As in prior years, there will be a _CollaborationFest_, a collaborative work event (including but not limited to hacking) happening around BOSC, this year right after the event on July 17/18.

There is still time to submit your abstracts for posters and talks. And there [is even an early poster submission/acceptance route that you can use until March 21](https://www.open-bio.org/2024/02/18/early-poster-acceptance-2024/). With this we want to make it easier for people to plan their travel to BOSC/ISMB.

The full list of key submission/notification dates is: 

* March 21, 2024: [Early Poster Acceptance submission deadline](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/03/09/bosc-early-poster-acceptance/)
* March 29: Early Poster Acceptance notification
* April 19: Regular abstract submission deadline (talks and posters)
* May 13: Talk/poster acceptance notification
* May 20: Late poster submission deadline

The actual conference dates are:

* July 12-16, 2024: ISMB 2024 (Montréal, Canada and online)
* July 15-16, 2024: BOSC 2024 (part of ISMB)
* July 17-18: Post-BOSC CollaborationFest


### OBF Event Fellowships

Next deadline: April 1, 2024

The current application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until April 1, 2024. So there is still some [time to get your application submitted](https://forms.gle/3yLg94G1C9nkZkvq5).

These fellowships are ideal to support your virtual or in-person BOSC attendance, but can also be used to cover registration fees for other relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as travel, lodging, childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet. You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/#fellowships-applications), and [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

### ISCBacademy events

The OBF is about to host another _ISCBacademy webinar_: On March 5, 2024, we will host Gemma Turon who is the co-founder and CEO of the _Ersilia Open Source Initiative_. In her talk, Gemma will present on _Ersilia, open source AI/ML for (antimicrobial) drug discovery_. The [details for how to attend are on the OBF website](https://www.open-bio.org/2024/02/08/iscbacademy-gemma-turon/)

Our previous ISCBacademy talk was on October 3, 2023 . We collaborated with the _Bio-Ontologies_ COSI and had Sierra Moxon speak about _"LinkML: an open data modeling framework, grounded with ontologies"_. The [recording of this talk is now on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyNp09WYLzw). 


## Community updates

### CWL Conference 2024

The [2024 Common Workflow Language Conference](https://www.commonwl.org/conferences/2024/) will be held primarily on the campus of VU Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, on Wednesday & Thursday May 15th & 16th. The event will be followed by a contribution-a-thon on that Friday. The conference talks will be also presented online, and there will be two online-only sessions the week prior at times convenient elsewhere in the world.

[The call for submissions is open!](https://forms.gle/LKCKaNkUWRLj35xL6) Responses are due by March 15th, 2024.

### Apply to join the Nebula Open Science Program by OLS and NASA

The [Nebula program](https://openlifesci.org/nasa/) is a dynamic 6-week online training designed for individuals and teams eager to integrate open science practices into their research. In collaboration with [NASA TOPS](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), OLS will offer five cohorts per year. Benefit from expert guidance, hands-on learning and tailored support to advance your projects. The next round of applications opens in late March.

## Your content needed for the next issue!

Tell us about the things that catch your attention in the open source bioinformatics world!
