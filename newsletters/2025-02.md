# OBF Newsletter February 2025

TL;DR: Updates from BOSC 2025, changes to the OBF fellowship and community news!

In longer form: 

## OBF News

### BOSC news

#### BOSC 2025

Our annual conference, the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/) (BOSC), will take place July 21-22, 2025 in Liverpool, UK as part of ISMB/ECCB 2025. This will be the 26th BOSC; as always, it will cover all aspects of open source bioinformatics and open science.
The second day of BOSC will be a joint session with the newly-renamed Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation. 
This day will feature a joint keynote and talks on some of our favorite topics, including open data and reusable and reproducible science.

To keep up with BOSC news, please follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14344023/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bosc.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://genomic.social/@BOSC), and [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/obf-bosc/shared_invite/zt-n5ur1gsj-z2C~69_4lYTFPg5tbWA8Ew)! (We are no longer on Twitter/X; [find out why](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/11/20/leaving-x/).)

### OBF Event Fellowships

Given the general cost-of-living increases and their impact on travel and event attendance, the OBF board has decided to **increase the maximum amount of funding that OBF Event Fellowships can cover to US $1,500**.    

Next deadline: April 1, 2025

The current application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until April 1, 2025, so there is still time to [get your application submitted](https://forms.gle/3yLg94G1C9nkZkvq5).

These fellowships are ideal to support your virtual or in-person participation in conferences related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as travel, lodging, childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet.

You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/#fellowships-applications), and [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

## Community updates

### sandbox.bio: Command-line tutorials

[sandbox.bio](https://sandbox.bio/) is a platform for bioinformatics command-line tutorials. 
Everything runs in your browser so no setup is required. 

Here are a few of their recent tutorials:

* [Wrangling FASTA/FASTQ files with SeqKit](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials/seqkit-intro)
* [Command-line exercises from a Carpentries tutorial](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials/carpentries-shell-novice)
* [Introduction to sequence alignment with BLAST](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials/blast-intro)


The biohackathons page, [https://biohackathons.github.io](https://biohackathons.github.io), lists more upcoming bioinformatics-related hackathons and similar events. And you can also [suggest your own additions](https://github.com/biohackathons/biohackathons.github.io/issues)! 

## Your content needed for the next issue!

Tell us about the things that catch your attention in the open source bioinformatics world! 
If you have an exciting project update, request for feedback, or interesting link, 
[feel free to share it with us on GitHub](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/issues/43), 
or contact Bastian Greshake Tzovaras (Mastodon: [@gedankenstuecke@scholar.social](https://scholar.social/@gedankenstuecke), Email: [bgreshake@gmail.com](mailto:bgreshake@proton.me)) if you're not sure whether or not your content is suitable for our newsletter. We're looking for content that's primarily open source / science related.
