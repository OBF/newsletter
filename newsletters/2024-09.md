### BOSC news

#### BOSC 2024: Watch the videos!

This year we celebrated the 25th annual _Bioinformatics Open Source Conference_ ([BOSC 2024](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024/)), 
which took place in July as part of ISMB 2024 alongside the post-conference _CollaborationFest_, 
a collaborative work event (including but not limited to hacking).

Our amazing conference organising committee has written up a report about the conference for F1000, which [will soon appear in the BOSC collection](https://f1000research.com/collections/bosc). 
In the meanwhile, you can [read Beatrice Mihalache's blog post about her experience at BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/2024/08/02/my-amazing-bosc-2024-experience/).
Also, the [BOSC talk videos are now available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhTZGLnFmh0&list=PLir-OOQiOhXZUNv8DStG8LC1I9-MoUgMh).

#### BOSC 2025: Save the date

In 2025, BOSC will take place in Liverpool, UK - as part of the [joint ISMB/ECCB conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home). 
The whole event will take place between July 20-24, 2025. 
The exact dates of BOSC within that range haven't been decided yet, but please save those dates in your calendar!

### OBF Event Fellowships

Next deadline: December 1, 2024

The current application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until December 1, 2024, so there is still time to [get your application submitted](https://forms.gle/3yLg94G1C9nkZkvq5).

These fellowships are ideal to support your virtual or in-person attendance of conferences related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as travel, lodging, childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet.

You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/#fellowships-applications), and [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

## Community updates

### Pydna Hackathon

The pydna Python package provides human-readable formal descriptions of üß¨ cloning and genetic assembly strategies in Python üêç that enable simulation and verification. 
Pydna can be used as [executable documentation for cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

You are invited to join the team to contribute or to learn how to use the library on October 3rd 2024, [more information is on GitHub](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna/discussions/258).

### ELIXIR Biohackathon

From November 4-8, 2024, the ELIXIR Biohackathon is taking place ¬≠‚Äî in-person in Barcelona and virtually online. While all in-person spots are taken, you can still [register to contribute remotely](https://elixir-europe.org/events/biohackathon-europe).

### Find upcoming open bioinformatics events

The Biohackathons page, [https://biohackathons.github.io](https://biohackathons.github.io), lists more upcoming bioinformatics-related hackathons and similar events. And you can also [suggest your own additions](https://github.com/biohackathons/biohackathons.github.io/issues)! 

## Your content needed for the next issue!

Tell us about the things that catch your attention in the open source bioinformatics world! 
If you have an exciting project update, request for feedback, or interesting link,
