# OBF Newsletter September 2023

TL;DR: In this newsletter we announce the OBF's upcoming public board meeting; provide a summary of BOSC 2023 in Lyon; share news about the OBF event fellowship; and announce an opening for an OBF admin for the 2024 Google Summer of Code. 

In longer form: 

## OBF News

### Upcoming public board meeting

The OBF is having its next public board meeting on XXX. On our agenda is XXX. You can find more details including how to join us on the OBF Blog [add link]. 

### BOSC news

The 24th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2023) took place in July as part of ISMB/ECCB 2023 in Lyon, France, and online. As in prior years, BOSC was preceded by a _CollaborationFest_, a collaborative work event (including but not limited to hacking). This year CoFest was hosted by Jérémy Just at the nearby _École Normale Supérieure de Lyon_, which sponsored space and infrastructure for the 25 in-person participants as well as the numerous online participants. 

In addition to 43 talks and nearly 50 posters, BOSC itself included two keynotes – by Sara El-Gebali, who spoke about _"A New Odyssey: Pioneering the Future of Scientific Progress Through Open Collaboration_ – and by Joseph Yracheta – who spoke about _"The Dissonance between Scientific Altruism & Capitalist Extraction: The Zero Trust and Federated Data Sovereignty Solution”_. The conference closed out with a panel on _Open & Ethical Data Sharing_. 

You can [read the full report about the conference on the OBF blog](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/08/14/bosc-2023-report/).

### OBF Travel Fellowships

Next round: December 1, 2023
Last round: August 1, 2023

The ongoing application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until December 1, 2023. So there is still some [time to get your application submitted](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMayX_XwTLxc8MiYgQOHIILJNjxF0gL75TUsbaO17h5UuUeA/viewform).

These fellowship can be used to cover registration fees for relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet. You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/#fellowships-applications), and [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

### Google Summer of Code

We are looking for a motivated person who would like to volunteer as the organisation admin to allow the OBF to participate in the 2024 Google Summer of Code. As an organisation we have been providing an umbrella project for various open source bioinformatics projects – including non-member projects – since 2010. In 2023 we sat out one round, as we did not find someone with the time to volunteer as GSoC admin. 

If you are interested to fill that role, please get in touch with us at XXX.

### ISCBacademy recording

On March 14, the OBF hosted the _ISCBacademy_ where Hannah Wei – co-founder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative – gave a talk on _"Re-Thinking the Patient’s Role in a Learning Health System: Lessons from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative"_. The [recording of the talk is now on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2vAotWKd_Q&feature=youtu.be).
