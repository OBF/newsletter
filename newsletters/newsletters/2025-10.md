# OBF Newsletter October 2025

TL;DR: Recapping BOSC 2025, preparing for GSoC 2026, OBF Event awards, new website, and community news!

In longer form: 

## OBF News

### BOSC news

#### BOSC 2025

The 2025 edition of our [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/) (July 21-22, 2025 as part of ISMB/ECCB 2025 in Liverpool, UK and online) was a great success, attracting at its peak around 280 in-person attendees.
Over two days, BOSC included two keynote addresses, a thought-provoking panel discussion, and plenty of talks and posters around open science, open source, and open data in bioinformatics.
This year, our [annual CollaborationFest was also part of ISMB/ECCB](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/ismb-collaborationfest-2025/), with about 60 people participating to contribute to open source projects.

The [organising committee wrote a report that is now available on F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/14-887), providing some deeper insights and reflections on BOSC & CollaborationFest. 

All the videos of the BOSC talks, including the keynotes, have now been released as well. You can [watch them on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OBFBOSC/videos) 
as well as find [direct links in our BOSC 2025 schedule page](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/bosc-2025-schedule/).

#### BOSC 2026: Save the date

In 2026, BOSC will again happen as part of the ISMB conference, taking place on two days between 13–16 July 2026 in Washington, DC, USA. 

To keep up with BOSC news, please follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14344023/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bosc.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://genomic.social/@BOSC), and [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/obf-bosc/shared_invite/zt-n5ur1gsj-z2C~69_4lYTFPg5tbWA8Ew)! (We are no longer on Twitter/X; [find out why](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/11/20/leaving-x/).)

### OBF Event Fellowships

Our event fellowship, which is aimed at increasing diverse participation and representation at events promoting open science practices around bioinformatics, continues.
So far, we supported 9 people in 2025, including 2 people in attending BOSC. 

**Next deadline: December 1, 2025**

The current application period for the OBF Event Fellowship lasts until December 1, 2025, so there is still time to [get your application submitted]( https://forms.gle/vDFTxT3uJwazQdSdA).

These fellowships are ideal to support your virtual or in-person participation in conferences related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), 
and potentially additional expenses such as travel, lodging, childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet.

You can read more about [applying for an OBF Event Fellowship on our blog](https://www.open-bio.org/2025/10/07/event-fellowship-2025-3/), 
where we also share [the experiences of past awardees](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/event-fellowship/).

### GSoC 2026 Call For Projects & co-admins

### A new OBF website

Earlier this year, [the OBF launched a new website](https://www.open-bio.org/posts/2025-03-04-new-website/). 
As part of this move, our website is now also [archived through the Rogue Scholar](https://www.open-bio.org/posts/2025-04-02-archiving-obf-posts/), 
which ensures that the blog posts will remain part of the long-term scientific record. 
It also means that our blog posts now have their own citeable DOI that [you can find on Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/search?q=metadata.creators.person_or_org.name%3A%22Open%20Bioinformatics%20Foundation%22&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest)!

## Community updates

### Layoffs at GigaScience

The journal GigaScience has been a mainstay in the OBF/BOSC space for 15 years. Beyond being a regular sponsor of BOSCs, the GigaScience team have been a steady presence at BOSCs, 
from talks and posters to organising birthday parties. 
As such, the recent news of GigaScience’s owners, BGI, laying off the entire editorial, software and curation team on short notice, 
has filled us with both surprise and deep disappointment. 

The larger OBF/BOSC community [has written a letter to express their concerns and disappointment](https://www.open-bio.org/2025/09/30/2025-09-30-gigascience/), 
while reflecting on all the achievements.

If you would like to sign this letter as well, you [can do so by making a pull request here](https://github.com/OBF/OBF.github.io/edit/main/content/posts/2025-09-30-gigascience.md).  

### openSNP has shut down

openSNP, the open-source/data platform that allowed donating human genotyping data from 23andMe et al. into the public domain, has shut down in April after operating for 14 years. 
The team decided to take this step over concerns how the current political forces in the USA could abuse such an open data resource.
openSNP co-founder (and OBF board member) Bastian Greshake Tzovaras [wrote about his reflections and the reasoning for shutting down now](https://tzovar.as/sunsetting-opensnp/).
