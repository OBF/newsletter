## OBF News

### OBF Event Fellowships (formerly "Travel Fellowships")

Previous round: October 1, 2022  
Next round: April 1, 2023

Our [call for applications is open again](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/20/obf-event-fellowship-2023-1-call/), with a **deadline on April 1st**. We invite applications for financial support to attend or host events taking place between May 2023 and April 2024.

As [described on the website](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/), the fellowship can be used to cover registration fees for relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet.

### BOSC News
 
Our annual get-together, the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2023](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/), will take place July 24-25 as a COSI of ISMB/ECCB 2023. It will once again be a hybrid event; in-person in Lyon (France), and online. We hope that the online component will offer the opportunity for many of you to participate that otherwise could not. 

Note that **the regular abstract submission deadline is April 20** and you can request assistance for registration fees when submitting an abstract.

**New this year**, BOSC is offering an "Early Poster Acceptance" option; so [submit your abstract](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/submit/) by March 31 to hear by April 6 whether it's been accepted for (at least) a poster!

For more detailed information, see the [BOSC 2023 webpage](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/).


#### BOSC keynote speaker nomination status update

We'd like to highlight that this year we are following a formal process for selecting a keynote speaker. After having put out a [public call for nominations](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/02/nominate-keynote-speaker-for-bosc-2023/), we held an [open commenting period](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/10/bosc-2023-keynote-comment-period/) on the shorlist of nominated speakers. The BOSC organizing committee has drawn on this list to extend invitations to potential keynote speakers. We'd love to hear your feedback about this process at any time.

### Fall 2022 OBF Board Meeting
The Board [met publicly on October 21, 2022](https://www.open-bio.org/2022/09/29/obf-public-board-meeting-2022-10-21/), with the following outcomes:

- Iddo Friedberg was elected as a new At-large Member.
- Nomi Harris was elected as Secretary, replacing Chris Fields in that role.
- Proposed updates to the bylaws were deferred to the next public Board meeting (date TBD).

The full meeting minutes are available in [this pull request](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/106) (to be merged at the next public Board meeting).


## Community updates

### Online webinar on patient-led research hosted by ISCBacademy
On March 14, we held a webinar about "Re-Thinking the Patientâ€™s Role in a Learning Health System: Lessons from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative" presented by Hannah Wei, co-founder and technologist at the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, hosted by [ISCBacademy](https://www.iscb.org/iscbacademy). See [the webinar announcement](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/09/iscbacademy-webinar-on-patient-led-research/) for a full description. The webinar recording is available on YouTube at [https://youtu.be/M2vAotWKd_Q](https://youtu.be/M2vAotWKd_Q). 

*If you're not familiar with [ISCBacademy](https://www.iscb.org/iscbacademy), it's a series of free webinars offered by the [ISCB](https://www.iscb.org/), which runs the annual ISMB conference, through the ISCB Communities of Special Interest (COSIs), which include BOSC/OBF.*


### Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. 

The OBF is not participating as a host organization this year, but our friends at the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) are, so we encourage you to check out their [call for applications](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health).

### Reads2Map: A collection of workflows to build linkage maps from sequencing data

As part of the [Tools for Polyploids](https://www.polyploids.org/) project, the [Reads2Map](https://github.com/Cristianetaniguti/Reads2Map) package integrates diverse computational tools for diploid and polyploid species genetic data analysis. It uses the reproducible and scalable structure of [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) to run SNP and dosage calling software and compare their performance using linkage maps as benchmarks. The main workflows' results can be easily evaluated in a [Shiny app](https://github.com/Cristianetaniguti/Reads2MapApp). The group already released a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.24.517847v2) with results for diploid analysis. The repository is being expanded and it has room for improvements and implementations of other software. The group is open for feedback or contributions through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Cristianetaniguti/Reads2Map/issues) page or the email chtaniguti@tamu.edu.
