## OBF News

### OBF Event Fellowships (formerly "Travel Fellowships")

Last round: October 1, 2022  
Next round: April 1, 2023

Our [call for applications is open again](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/20/obf-event-fellowship-2023-1-call/), with a **deadline on April 1st**. We invite applications for financial support to attend or host events taking place between May 2023 and April 2024.

As [described on the website](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/), the fellowship can be used to cover registration fees for relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), or high-speed internet.

### BOSC News
 
Our annual get-together, the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2023, will take place July 24-25 as a COSI of ISMB/ECCB 2023. It will once again be a hybrid event; in-person in Lyon (France), and online. We hope that the online component will offer the opportunity for many of you to participate that otherwise could not. 

Note that **the abstract submission deadline is April 20** and you can request assistance for registration fees when submitting an abstract. 

For more detailed information, see the [BOSC 2023 webpage](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/).


#### BOSC Keynote speaker nomination status update

We'd like to highlight that this year we are following a formal process for selecting a keynote speaker. After having put out a [public call for nominations](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/02/nominate-keynote-speaker-for-bosc-2023/), we held an [open commenting period](https://www.open-bio.org/2023/02/10/bosc-2023-keynote-comment-period/) on the shorlist of nominated speakers. In the following weeks, the BOSC organizing committee will draw on this list to extend invitations to potential keynote speakers. We'd love to hear your foeedback about this process at any time.


### Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. 

The OBF is applying again as a host organization, and as in past years we will work as an umbrella organization for sub-projects. Do you have an open + bio related project that could use the help of a student intern? If so, please [read the contributor guidelines](https://www.open-bio.org/events/gsoc/gsoc-guide/) then submit your project ideas!
