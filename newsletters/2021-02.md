## OBF News

### The OBF is seeking community volunteers to join the board.

As our board member [Yo Yehudi reaches the end of her term](https://www.open-bio.org/2021/02/12/would-you-like-to-make-a-difference-in-grassroots-open-bioinformatics/), we are reflecting on the need to recruit new and more diverse board members. To that end we particularly invite members from low-tech/low-income communities or historically marginalised groups to bring new perspectives to the OBF community. 

The elected members of the OBF Board will be instrumental in steering our work to address urgent challenges and needs in open source bioinformatics communities that we might not have yet recognized. If the OBFâ€™s goals and values resonate with you, we encourage you to nominate yourself by 1 April 2021.

### OBF Event Fellowships

Our [call for applications is open again, with a deadline on April 1st](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/). We invite applications for financial support to attend or host virtual events in 2021. 

The fellowship can be used to cover registration fees and potentially additional expenses such as small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), childcare for the duration of the event or high-speed internet.

Due to the on-going pandemic and lockdowns & travel restriction associated with it we again only consider virtual events.

### BOSC news

BOSC 2021 will be held as part of the ISMB/ECCB this year and will again be fully virtual. We hope that this will be offering the opportunity for many of you to participate that otherwise could not. The abstract submission deadline is **May 6** and you can request assistance for registration fees when submitting an abstract.
