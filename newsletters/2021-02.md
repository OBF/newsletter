## OBF News

### The OBF is seeking community volunteers to join the board.

As our board member [Yo Yehudi reaches the end of her term](https://www.open-bio.org/2021/02/12/would-you-like-to-make-a-difference-in-grassroots-open-bioinformatics/), we are reflecting on the need to recruit new and more diverse board members. To that end we particularly invite members from low-tech/low-income communities or historically marginalised groups to bring new perspectives to the OBF community. The elected members of the OBF Board will be instrumental in steering our work to address urgent challenges and needs in open source bioinformatics communities that we might not have yet recognized.

If the OBFâ€™s goals and values resonate with you, we encourage you to nominate yourself by 1 April 2021.
