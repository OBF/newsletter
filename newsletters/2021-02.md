# OBF Newsletter March 2021

TL;DR: The OBF is looking for new board members. Our event fellowship applications are open. It's time to submit your abstract for BOSC. 

In longer form:

## OBF News

### The OBF is inviting new Board member candidates

As our board member [Yo Yehudi reaches the end of her term](https://www.open-bio.org/2021/02/12/would-you-like-to-make-a-difference-in-grassroots-open-bioinformatics/), we are reflecting on the need to recruit new and more diverse board members. To that end we particularly invite members from low-tech/low-income communities or historically marginalised groups to bring new perspectives to the OBF community. 

The elected members of the OBF Board will be instrumental in steering our work to address urgent challenges and needs in open source bioinformatics communities that we might not have yet recognized. If the OBFâ€™s goals and values resonate with you, we encourage you to nominate yourself for consideration by 1 April 2021.

### OBF Event Fellowships

Our [call for applications is open again, with a **deadline on April 1st**](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/). We invite applications for financial support to attend or (new!) host virtual events in 2021. 

The fellowship can be used to cover registration fees and potentially additional expenses such as small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam), childcare for the duration of the event or high-speed internet.

Due to the ongoing pandemic and lockdowns & travel restriction associated with it we again will only consider virtual events.

### Request for comment on the Code and Conduct draft

OBF is committed to providing a harassment-free and respectful environment for all members of our community. To ensure that we describe norms, rules, and recommended practices for all our participants and members, we are providing the first draft of OBF Code of Conduct, which is open for comments on our GitHub repository. Please take a few minutes to review the draft and share comment on [Pull Request #78](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/78). With your feedback we will ensure that we provide clear guidelines of reporting incidents and describe how reports will be handled.

### BOSC news

BOSC 2021 will be held as part of ISMB/ECCB this year and will again be fully virtual. We hope that this will offer the opportunity for many of you to participate that otherwise could not. The abstract submission deadline is **May 6** and you can request assistance for registration fees when submitting an abstract.

### Google Summer of Code

It's the season for Google Summer of Code applications again. The OBF is applying again as an organization and as in past years we will work as an umbrella organization for sub-projects. Do you have an open + bio related proejct that could use the help of a student intern? If so, please submit your project ideas!

## Community updates & interesting links

### Transbiome: A participant-led microbiome study

Clara Lehenaff, a Master student at the University of Paris, is launching a citizen science project on the neovaginal microbiome of trans women to address a big gap in scientific knowledge and potentially improve trans healthcare. In the spirit of the OBF all deidentified data will be openly shared.

### Your content needed for the next issue!

Tell us about the things that catch your attention in the open source bioinformatics world! If you have an exciting project update, request for feedback, or interesting link, [feel free to share it with us on GitHub](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/issues/15), or contact Bastian Greshake Tzovaras ([Twitter: @gedankenstuecke](https://twitter.com/gedankenstuecke), [Email: bgreshake@googlemail.com](mailto:bgreshake@googlemail.com)) if you're not sure whether or not your content is suitable for our newsletter - we're looking for content that's primarily open source / science related.
