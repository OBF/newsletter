# OBF Newsletter July/August 2022

BOSC 2022 was amazing; BOSC 2023 will be part of ISMB/ECCB in Lyon, France + online. Our next event fellowship application deadline is Oct 1. The Nextflow community is having a get-together, GA4GH wants your thoughts on their Code of Conduct, and educators are invited to use the cloud to teach genomics.

### BOSC News

**[BOSC 2022](http://open-bio.org/events/bosc/bosc-2022/)** took place in July as a Community of Special Interest (COSI) of [ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022), which was held as a hybrid event, in-person in Madison, WI (USA) and online. Over the two days of the BOSC COSI, approximately 200 people participated in [BOSC sessions](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2022/bosc-2022-schedule/), which included 28 talks chosen from submitted abstracts, 46 posters, and a [panel discussion, “Building and Sustaining Inclusive Open Science Communities”](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2022/bosc-2022-panel/). BOSC 2022 included [joint keynotes](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2022/bosc-2022-keynotes/) with two other COSIs. Jason Williams gave a BOSC / Education COSI keynote entitled "Riding the bicycle: Including all scientists on a path to excellence". A joint session with Bio-Ontologies featured a keynote by Melissa Haendel, “The open data highway: turbo-boosting translational traffic with ontologies.”

A [report about BOSC 2022](https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1034) has been published as part of the [BOSC collection on F1000](https://f1000research.com/collections/bosc). All BOSC presenters are encouraged to submit their presentation slides and/or posters to the collection by September 30, 2022.

You can find personal accounts of BOSC 2022 on the OBF blog: 
- Festus Nyasimi, a co-founder and lead of the Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Initiative (BHKi), shares the story of [his journey to the ISMB/BOSC 2022 conference on an OBF Event Fellowship](https://www.open-bio.org/2022/08/01/obf-event-fellow2022-fnyasimi/) (see next section for info about Event Fellowships).
- Geraldine Van der Auwera collected impressions and takeaways from multiple BOSC participants in [a blog that will make you wish you were at BOSC 2022 last month and plan to be at BOSC 2023 next year](https://www.open-bio.org/2022/08/16/crowdsourced-highlights-from-bosc-2022/). 

**BOSC 2023** will take place in July as a COSI of [ISMB/ECCB 2023](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023) as a hybrid event; in-person in Lyon (France), and online.


### OBF Event Fellowships (formerly "Travel Fellowships")

Last round: April 1, 2022  
Next round: October 1, 2022

Our [call for applications is open again](https://www.open-bio.org/2022/08/12/obf-event-fellowship-2022-round2/), with a **deadline on October 1st**. We invite applications for financial support to attend or host events taking place between November 1, 2022 and November 1, 2023.

As [described on the website](https://www.open-bio.org/event-awards/), the fellowship can be used to cover registration fees for relevant events related to open source bioinformatics or open science (in-person or virtual), and potentially additional expenses such as childcare for the duration of the event, small hardware (e.g. a headset or webcam),  or high-speed internet.

### Google Summer of Code

The OBF acts as an umbrella host organization for open source organizations who wish to work with a student for the four months of Google Summer of Code. This year, we're pleased to have six students on board, working on a range of projects. Learn more about the students, their projects and their OBF mentors on the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/open-bioinformatics-foundation-obf) site.


## Community updates

### Nextflow community events in October

### Seeking feedback: GA4GH Code of Conduct 
The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework. The organization is seeking community feedback on its draft [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qcon1ZyT1VbaYYXuoH6xIicTB7CJsHForErcksqWxIU/edit?usp=sharing), which will replace its original [Standards for Professional Conduct](https://www.ga4gh.org/wp-content/uploads/GA4GH-Standards-for-Professional-Conduct-22-Jan-2018.pdf) document from 2018.

### Genomics in the classroom
Do you teach genomics or a related discipline in a classroom setting, and want to run hands-on exercises without sweating the IT stuff? The [Terra blog](https://terra.bio/blog/) recently featured an [ASHG webinar on using cloud resources for teaching genomics](https://terra.bio/anvil-in-the-classroom-cloud-scale-educational-resources-for-modern-genomics/), which provided an overview of useful resources and a live demonstration. The recording is available [on-demand from ASHG](https://learning.ashg.org/products/anvil-in-the-classroom-cloud-scale-educational-resources-for-modern-genomics#tab-product_tab_contents__1) (free registration required).
