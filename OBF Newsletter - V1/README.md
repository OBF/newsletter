# OBF Newsletter
The Newsletter has three main components = HTML+CSS+images
1. There are placeholders for all the images and text. 
2. Just open the index file and make changes in the text mostly enclosed in <p></P> tags
3. To change pictures just rezise your images according to the placeholders and edit the link to the folder where the images are placed
4. Made CSS inline. i.e. the styling and text part is all in one file with styling followed by text.
5. Easily change colors,font type, font size, text by replacing the placeholder text.

#Improvements to be made
1. Make CSS inline to shorten the code and reduce the number of files -- Done
3. Comment out the code (to make it easy to understand and contribute to the same)--Partially done
