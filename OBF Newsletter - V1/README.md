# OBF Newsletter
The Newsletter has three main components = html+CSS+images
1. There are placeholders for all the images and text. 
2. Just open the index file and make changes in the text mostly enclosed in <p></P> tags
3. To change pictures just rezise your images according to the placeholders and edit the link to the folder where the images are placed
4. To make changes with the look and feel of the newsletter -> open the index.css file and make changes to colors, text size, fonts etc. according to the element code -> which is same for both index.html and index.css
5. Since it's coded using html+css it's ready to be placed on the website. It's a complete webpage.

#Improvements to be made
1. Make CSS inline to shorten the code and reduce the number of files
3. Comment out the code (to make it easy to understand and contribute to the same)
