# OBF Newsletter

## Open call for content

The OBF newsletter aims to provide updates for member projects, members, and interesting open source/science/bioinformatics links. All contributions are welcome, although they will be subject to a brief review process.

## What can I contribute?

This could be a new project launch, an interesting update or release, a link to useful resources (e.g. some nice biology related icons or an open source tool that could be useful, etc. Promoting yourself or your workplace is totally ok here - this is literally what the newsletter is for, within reason! 

If you aren't sure about something, feel free to drop a line personally to Yo Yehudi to discuss it, e.g. via [twitter](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi) or email (yochannah@gmail.com).

## How can I submit an item?

We always have an issue accepting submissions for the next newsletter. Look for the "upcoming issue" tag and leave a comment with a description of the item you'd like to share!
