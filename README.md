# OBF Newsletter

If you want to receive our (low-frequency) newsletter: We are sending it through the _[bosc-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/bosc-announce/)_ and _[open-bio-l](http://mailman.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/open-bio-l/)_ mailing lists. 
 

You can [view table of contents for historical issues](table-of-contents.md)

## Open call for content

The OBF newsletter aims to provide updates for member projects, members, and interesting open source/science/bioinformatics links. All contributions are welcome, although they will be subject to a brief review process.

## What can I contribute?

This could be a new project launch, an interesting update or release, a link to useful resources (e.g. some nice biology related icons or an open source tool that could be useful, etc. Promoting yourself or your workplace is totally ok here - this is literally what the newsletter is for, within reason!

If you aren't sure about something, feel free to drop a line personally to Bastian Greshake Tzovaras to discuss it, e.g. via [Mastodon](https://scholar.social/@gedankenstuecke) or email (bgreshake@proton.me).

## How can I submit an item?

We always have an issue open accepting submissions for the next newsletter. Look for the "[upcoming issue](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aupcoming-issue)" tag and leave a comment with a description of the item you'd like to share!
